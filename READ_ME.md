## Backend
1. Choosing and enviroment - like before the building of a house, a good enviroment will allow for our machine learning code to run.
  - Python
  - Anaconda [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution]
    - Spyder
  - Model [https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDaltonic%2Fpredictive%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fmodel]
- Machine learning algorithm called “RandomForestClassifier” of the sklearn library
